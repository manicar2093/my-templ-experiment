# templ-demo

This is the initial code for the greatest project ever made.

## Tools

Yep, you need to install some tools to make this work:

- [Go](https://go.dev/): That's why you are here, right? :P
- [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/): A task runner used instead Makefile
- [Air](https://github.com/air-verse/air): Live reload tool for Go apps
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/es): Needed to run npx command

## Thank you!

Be yourself. Find joy by what you do. Happy coding :)
